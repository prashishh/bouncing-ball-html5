## Animate the Web
This is a part of a *scrum* activitiy for the [Mozilla Festival 2013][mozfest].

The main objective behind the __Animate the Web__ scrum tasks are that they are quick-start activities that anyone can come up to the Scrum Board, pick up and work on it. We have built prototypes of few HTML5 Canvas-based animations that people can build remixes of. The samples that are provided are well commented and easy to understand. The samples provide a basic skeleton so that people can play around with the code and hack their own version.

I have posted some ideas that people can make using the samples provided.

*Scrums are sets of community-run makes and activities that are based on making or building something together.*

_This is a part of **Build and Teach the Web** track at MozFest! Keep the web wild through hands-on making with innovative tools and teaching the web as a community._
