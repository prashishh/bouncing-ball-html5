### Single-ball Bouncing Ball

A single ball bounces around the canvas box. The index.html file is well commented and easy to understand.

Few minor hacks:

- change ball color
- change size of canvas
- change size of ball
- __add blocks or obstructions__
- __add elasticity effect__
- __add friction__
