### Bouncing Ball

This is a classic example of a HTML5 canvas game. The bouncing ball is a fundamental concept to many game development logics and can be easily modified build lot of other games like - ping-pong, brick breaker etc.

Here are few examples/extension of bouncing ball that you can use as a starting point.

- [Single-ball Bouncing Ball][single]
- [Multiple-ball Bouncing Ball][multiple]
- [HTML5 Text Bouncing Balls][text]

Few minor hacks:

- change ball color, size
- change number of balls
- __add blocks or obstructions__
- __add elasticity effect__
- __add friction__

Some ideas for extension:

- [Ping-pong][pong]
- [Brick Breaker][brick-breaker]
