### Multiple-ball Bouncing Ball

Multiple balls bounces around the canvas box. The index.html file is well commented and easy to understand.

Few minor hacks:

- change number of balls
- change size of canvas
- randomize size of each ball
- keep all the colors of balls same
- __add blocks or obstructions__
- __add elasticity effect__
- __add friction__
